# Max Rectangle Algorithm Solution
I will describe three ways to solve this problem.

## My Assumptions:
For all the algorithms that are presented here I offer to do the following pre-processing actions:
1. Since we are interested and affected only by what happens inside the container, we will trim all the rectangles that are fully or partially located outside the container:
2. Personally I prefer working where the container always starts at (0,0). This is acheived simply by shifting the container and the rectangles in the X and Y axises and shiting back the result.

## Solution 1: Brute Force (^2)
The first solution is to divide 


## Solution 2: Improved Brute Force

## Solution 3: The Real Solution
